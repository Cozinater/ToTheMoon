# ToTheMoon

A React + TypeScript + Vite app.

## Tech stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Vite**
- **TanStack Router** — routing (code-based)
- **TanStack Query** — server state / data fetching & caching
- **TanStack Table** — data tables
- **React Hook Form** — forms
- **Tailwind CSS v4** + **shadcn/ui** (Radix) — styling & components
- **Lucide** — icons

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start the dev server
npm run build    # typecheck + production build
npm run lint     # run ESLint
npm run preview  # preview the production build
```

## Project structure

The app is organized **by feature**: shared building blocks live at the top of
`src/`, and each domain of the app gets its own self-contained folder under
`features/`. Dependencies point downward — routes use features, features use
shared components and `lib`, and `components/ui` depends on nothing of ours.

```

### Conventions

- **Keep code where it's used.** Feature-specific components, hooks, and types
  live in that feature's folder. Only promote something to the top-level
  `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, or `types/` once a *second* feature needs it.
- **Path alias:** `@/` resolves to `src/` (e.g. `import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"`).
- **Adding a route:** create a file in `src/routes/` and register it in
  `src/router.tsx`. (To switch to file-based routing, install
  `@tanstack/router-plugin` and wire it into `vite.config.ts`.)
- **Adding a component:** use the shadcn CLI — it drops primitives into
  `src/components/ui/`. Don't hand-edit those.
